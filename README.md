# social-media-api

## Description 

This Social Network API was a challenge to test my skills of being able to CRUD with MongoDB & Mongoose. 
The technologies I used were MongoDB, Mongoose & Express. 
This is the back-end side of a Social Network app, if time is available. I would love to connect this with a front-end to make it a full stack app.
In the meantime, Enjoy!
